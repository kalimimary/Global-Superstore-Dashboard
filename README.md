# Global-Superstore-Dashboard

## Introduction:
This is an excel project on an online store called Global superstore based in New York. The project is to analyse and derive insights to answer crucial questions and also help them make decisions.

##_Disclaimer_## :
All datasets and reports do not represent any company, institution or country, but just a dummy dataset to demonstrate my capabilities of Excel.

## Problem statement: 
- What are the three countries that generated the highest total profit for Global Superstore in 2014? 
- For each of these three countries, find the three products with the highest total profit. Specifically, what are the products’ names and the total profit for each product?
- Identify the 3 subcategories with the highest average shipping cost in the United States.

- Assess Nigeria’s profitability (i.e., total profit) for 2014. How does it compare to other African countries?
- What factors might be responsible for Nigeria’s poor performance? You might want to investigate shipping costs and the average discount as potential root causes.

- Identify the product subcategory that is the least profitable in Southeast Asia.
  Note: For this question, assume that Southeast Asia comprises Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar (Burma), the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.
- Is there a specific country in Southeast Asia where Global Superstore should stop offering the subcategory identified in 4a?

5) Which city is the least profitable (in terms of average profit) in the United States? For this analysis, discard the cities with less than 10 Orders. b) Why is this city’s average 
   profit so low?

6) Which product subcategory has the highest average profit in Australia?

7) Who are the most valuable customers and what do they purchase?
